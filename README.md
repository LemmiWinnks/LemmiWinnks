We are about to study the idea of a computational process. <br>
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. <br>
As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. <br>
The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. <br>
People create programs to direct processes. <br>
In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells. <br>
