We are about to study the idea of a computational process. \n
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. \n
As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. \n
The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. \n
People create programs to direct processes. \n
In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells. \n
